      <h2>How to take your media literacy to the next level</h2>
      <p>
        This project goes over the 12 Media Literacy Guidelines detailed in W.
        James Potter's, "Introduction to Media Literacy", my interpretation of
        those guidelines, as well as how I plan to integrate a handful of these
        guidelines into my daily life, in pursuit of a more developed sense of
        media literacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll first examine what media means to me, followed by a brief
        description of how I interpreted these guidelines. I've selected six
        different guidelines in which I feel I'm currently lacking, included
        with a brief strategy on how I would like to improve this aspect of my
        media literacy. My long-term plan is quickly outlined in the following
        section, where I detail the steps I'll take to ensure these changes
        aren't short lived.
