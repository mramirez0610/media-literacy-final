        Media literacy is a combination of so many different intricate parts
        moving in one big machine. Having media literacy doesn't just mean being
        able to decipher messages from the media you consume, it's understanding
        why those messages were broadcasted in the first place. It's delving
        deeper into the industry's intentions behind specific messages, the
        narrative structure behind it, understanding why shows are produced in
        certain ways, why genres are structured how they are, etc. etc.

        To have a strong sense of media literacy is to know what you want, and
        knowing what you will spend your time engaging with to receive more
        information on your goals. It all really stems back to the first
        guideline, strengthening your personal locus. If you don't know what you
        want, how are you ever going to get it? How will you ever gain the
        drive?
