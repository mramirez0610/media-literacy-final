      <h2>My Relationship with Media</h2>
      <p>
        Before we get into everything, I'd like to talk about my personal
        connection to media. When I was younger, I consumed a lot of media. From
        the ages of 10 - 22 (right now), I've always engaged with media. I've
        watched movies, played games, read books, listened to music, and have
        tried my hand at creating my own media numerous times. I really do love
        media, as silly as that sounds. But as much as I love the mediums that I
        constantly consume, I have to admit that they've formed & affected my
        life in a variety of ways, some negative and some positive. In recent
        months, I've intended to change my relationship with media and create
        boundaries in my usage, as well as how the messages broadcasted affect
        my life.
      </p>
      <h2>Current Habits</h2>
      <p>
        My current media consumption habits are - in a word - okay. I'm
        definitely not on my devices too much, but I'm not in the state that I
        would like to be. Right now, I feel that I spend too much time watching
        shows, rather than being on my phone which is probably a good thing. The
        device I spend the most time on is my laptop, and it's mostly for
        professional purposes, studying, and working on personal projects.
      </p>
      <h2>Current Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        I know that I could be spending less time on my devices. I find myself
        falling into Instagram for 30 minutes straight, and not knowing where
        the time went. But, I also feel myself actively distancing myself from
        my phone since enabling screen time limits. The media I engage with
        right now is purely fictional, consisting of television shows, and
        playing video games occasionally. I rarely engage with non-fictional
        media, and would like to change that in the future.
