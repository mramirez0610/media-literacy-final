By conditioning you to engage in these patterns every day, you have become a tool for the media. Being aware of your needs, and seeking out media to help attain those needs, you are maximizing your media exposure to meet your own needs.</p>"

(If you used to watch mainly sports and action/adventure on TV, are you now spreading your viewing around to a wider range of genres?)\"</li></ul><p>Explore.

Amassing more information on a subject is solely dependent on us and our interest in a topic. Having general interest in a topic pushes us to seek information through a variety of different media outlets, as one can assume. Though, if our interest a topic is lacking, it's common to allow the mass-media determine the information we digest on it. By closing these gaps of knowledge over topics that we might not have the most knowledge in, we start to lay solid groundwork in our media literacy.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Media is never just reality, or just fantasy. There will always be a mix of both in every message we receive from the programs we consume. Understanding this comes along with the burdensome task of deciphering what is \"real\", and what is \"fake\" in media; and even then, those labels cannot accurately describe the heavy mix of reality and fantasy in contemporary media. The line is extremely blurred. Being wary of what messages you perceive as entirely \"real\" is necessary, and analysis of the messages you welcome in is something that takes time. Without caution, it's easy to accept fictional messages as real. It's easy to create unrealistic expectations in life due to these messages. Messages in the media are created to influence your train of though, and by not understanding the difference, you let the intended message land.</p>"

When it comes to consuming media, I've never really sat down to track what types of media I'm consuming. I've always known my few general topics, but never anything deeper than that. I have noticed that through the years, I've definitely stayed within a state of automaticity and consume mostly the same content.</p><h3>Strategy</h3><p>Currently, the media I consume the most of right now are television programs and films. I've been keeping a very loose media diary within the last 3 weeks or so, and I've noticed a lot of my media exposure is to fictional content, but content that is more rooted in reality. What I'd like to do is consume more educational content, so I'd like to attempt to view something that teaches me about something I'm not quite familiar on once a week</p>"

Unfortunately, most of my predisposed knowledge of conflicting opinions is from the mass media. This is something that I'd like to change.</p><h3>Strategy</h3><p>My plan to expand my knowledge is relatively simple on paper, but will be difficult to hold myself to. Once a week I'd like to consume one well-regarded piece of media, more specifically a movie, documentary, or an episode of a show, over a topic that I'm not the biggest fan of. The purpose of this is to see other perspectives that I usually wouldn't align myself with.</p>"
