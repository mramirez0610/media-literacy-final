Without a strong personal locus, the rest of the guidelines are irrelevant.</p><ul><li>Your personal locus is a combination of an awareness of your goals, as well as the drive to seek information & experiences that can help you attain those goals.</li><li>It starts with your personal goalsâ€”what makes you happy, how you enjoy spending your time, what you want to achieve in life.</li><li>Once you understand your goals, try and understand where these influences come from. Are they from the real world, or media influence? Are you comfortable with how your goals have been shaped?</li><li>The next step is knowing your willingness to put forth the mental effort to satisfy your needs. Avoiding challenge and dismissing critical engagement with media causes comprehension to fall.</li><li>Engaging with challenging messages can lead to better understanding, which helps us seek new information that can benefit us long-term.</li></ul>"

        "description": "<p>A question most people should be thinking while consuming media is, \"Whose needs am I serving most?\" Engaging in habitual media exposure patterns with no particular needs is the goal of mass media. By conditioning you to engage in these patterns every day, you have become a tool for the media. Being aware of your needs, and seeking out media to help attain those needs, you are maximizing your media exposure to meet your own needs.</p>"

(If you used to watch mainly sports and action/adventure on TV, are you now spreading your viewing around to a wider range of genres?)\"</li></ul><p>Explore. Explore more media, push yourself out of your comfort zone; watch new shows, read magazines, listen to new music, even if you hate it all.

        "description": "<p>Being continually aware of your needs can allow you to understand what knowledge to seek out. Amassing more information on a subject is solely dependent on us and our interest in a topic. Having general interest in a topic pushes us to seek information through a variety of different media outlets, as one can assume. Though, if our interest a topic is lacking, it's common to allow the mass-media determine the information we digest on it. By closing these gaps of knowledge over topics that we might not have the most knowledge in, we start to lay solid groundwork in our media literacy.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Media is never just reality, or just fantasy. There will always be a mix of both in every message we receive from the programs we consume. Understanding this comes along with the burdensome task of deciphering what is \"real\", and what is \"fake\" in media; and even then, those labels cannot accurately describe the heavy mix of reality and fantasy in contemporary media. The line is extremely blurred. Being wary of what messages you perceive as entirely \"real\" is necessary, and analysis of the messages you welcome in is something that takes time. Without caution, it's easy to accept fictional messages as real. It's easy to create unrealistic expectations in life due to these messages. Messages in the media are created to influence your train of though, and by not understanding the difference, you let the intended message land.</p>"

A common issue in today's society is the idealization of specific opinions/issues due to media consciousness, but not following with the actions to help stop the issue. An example of this, although a bit paradoxical, is the movement to take the power of current day technology away, and create a healthy social boundary that's seemingly disappeared within the last decade or so. Though many people claim to want this change, technology has integrated itself into every second of daily life, and will continue to unless behaviors are changed. Examine your beliefs.
